          "text": "Mark B. Barron — Technologist who works on extraordinarily difficult projects. CapitalCrew inventor Mark Barron started his first business as a child and has remained driven by new challenges ever since. Born January 15, 1958 in San Diego to Navy Seal Ace Bowen and his wife Julie, Barron relocated to Los Angeles at age five, began selling baby chicks at seven, and faced early struggles with dyslexia and school discipline. He attended Chaminade in Chatsworth for structure and reform school for one year. Later, while visiting a video game store on 5th Avenue with his young son, he observed there were no games encouraging positive development—only violent titles like Grand Theft Auto and Mortal Kombat—which inspired his mission to innovate educational gaming. Barron, an inventor from Los Angeles with patents spanning decades, has worked on solutions from preventing chemotherapy hair loss to developing exterior safety systems for mass transit. Neurodivergent since childhood, his unique perspective fueled empathy for kids trapped in cycles that lead to incarceration in a country housing 25% of the world’s prisoners."

          "text": "Determined to make gaming both fun and formative, Barron created 'Trust Fund Battle,' a dedicated game platform where players complete courses and levels to earn real monetary rewards deposited in U.S. Treasury-certified trust accounts. His vision is that even marginalized youth can build assets for their future while playing. Barron aims to partner with major game studios and community leaders to blend entertainment with education in a way that supports parents and prevents youth incarceration. His next project, 'I SCORE,' expands upon this vision, rewarding adolescents for learning and positive behavior. 'I SCORE' monitors progress with eye-recognition tech, offers rewards for achievements, and can support employer vetting or even military MOS/AFSC classifications. Topics explored include 'carnivore capitalism,' corporate excess, prison industry insights, and more—presented with energy and cultural relevance."

Public Transportation Safety International’s S-1 Gard dangerzone deflector protects people from bus wheel injuries, deployed in cities like Los Angeles and D.C. His Bel Air X platform brings telepresent shopping via live visual feeds from stores to consumers. Living in Bel Air since purchasing Quincy Jones’s former home in 2005, Barron legally changed his name to Mark Bowen Barron in 2010. His journey from reform school student to multi-patented inventor demonstrates a lifetime dedicated to solving difficult systemic problems and building safe, empowering technology."

Discover how the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is transforming lives through 'Make America Healthy Again' (MAHA). The initiative, launched in 2025, tackles America’s chronic disease crisis—impacting one in two adults—through proactive strategies such as eliminating petroleum dyes, integrating nutrition in medical education, and addressing environmental toxins that destabilize health and communities. MAHA’s core principle is prevention through empowerment. Its partnership with ACYF and DOJ exemplifies cross-agency collaboration for safer futures and stronger families."

Through initiatives like the Children’s Justice Act and the Family Violence Prevention Program, ACYF provides tools that directly reduce trauma and delinquency risks. Her 2025–2029 plan integrates data-driven strategies aligned with MAHA’s health mission to ensure trauma is prevented before it occurs."
